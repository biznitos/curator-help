POST CAPTURE FORM
=================

You can create a new post on any page by preparing a form with these attributes.

Form Action:
/api/post/v1

Method:
POST

Required Fields
* title
* type
* return_url - The URL to go to when the lead form is successful
* failure_url - The URL to return to when the lead form failed
* customer[email] - email address of the person filling this form (if person is logged in, not needed)
* customer[name] - name of the person filling the form (if person is logged in, not needed)

NOTE:
Customer[xxxxxx] information will only be added once. 
If the customer already exists in the system, this information 
will not overwrite what's already there. 
Create a profile update form to deal with that.
If the person is already logged into the site, these will be ignored.

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
* cover_image (an upload field with the main image for the post)
* pubdate = "now" (will publish the post -- don't do this unless you really want to)
* files[] (a list of files that you want to attach to the post -- typically images, but can be any kind of file)

ADDITIONAL ADDITIONAL NOTES:
return_url 
You can add an __id__, __zid__, or __permlaink__ in the return_url template.
Example: "/foo?id=__id__"

NEW POST NOTIFICATION
=====================
You can send a generic email notification when a new post has been created.
Add the hidden (or other) field:
* notify (single email address to send notification)
