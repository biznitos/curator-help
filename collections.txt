COLLECTIONS
===========

A collection can be a list of posts, users, leads, etc.
Special tags bring collections into the current liquid contex.

Leads
-----
Returns list of leads from the current site
with specific filters.
{% leads [options] %}

Options:
user_id - Leads with a a specific user_site.id 
current_user - Leads for the currently logged in user, can be any value
type - type of lead
subtype - subtype of lead
limit - how many records (default 10)

Leads will always be ordered by most recently added first.

Example - show last 10 leads for currently logged_in user:
{% leads current_user:1, limit: 10 %}

Example - show last 5 leads of type "open"
{% leads type: "open", limit: 5 %}

Posts
-----
Return list of posts from the current site
with specific filters.
{% posts [options] %}

>> Query Fields:
type - type of post
subtype - subtype of post
id
zid
src
src_id
permalink
parent_zid
created_by

>> Ordering, Naming & Limiting
limit - how many posts to return
order - how to sort posts ("updated", "alpha", "newest", "pubdate" - default: "pubdate")
query - fulltext search string
name - the name of the collection instead of "posts"
one - truthy -- returns a single post not in an array

Example - show most recently published 10 posts
{% posts limit:10 %}

Example - show posts ordered alphabetically and renamed to "alpha_posts"
{% posts limit:10, order:"alpha", name:"alpha_posts" %}

Example - returns a single post and calls it "blog" in the context
{% posts zid: "12345..", name: "blog" %}

Options
-------
When passing options, quotes are important

"foo" - literal foo will be passed as an option
foo (without quotes) will first lookup the value of foo in the global liquid context

Example:
"site.name" - will output literally "site.name"
site.name - will output the name of the site, eg: "Biznitos"
