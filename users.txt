USERS
=====

Curator comes with a built in public user page.

Example:
"https://yoursite.com/user/skylar"

Notes:
Users are assigned a random username upon creation. 
They can change this on the account update page "/account".

Templates:
To display a username, you have to create a template with the permalink "user".

Template Variables:
In the template, the following liquid data will exists:

* {{member.id}} (the user_id of this user)
* {{member.username}}
* {{member.zid}}
* {{member.role}}
* {{member.data}} (map)
* {{member.notes}}
* {{member.usubscribed}} (boolean)
* {{member.user.all-user-fields}} (read page on user fields)

IMPORTANT
=========
We do not use the {{user}} variable, since this is reserved for the currently logged in user.

FOLLOW
======
You can follow a user if currently logged in:

URL:
/api/follow/v1

Parameters:
username -- the username of the user to follow. Must be a member of the current site.
return_url -- where to redirect to
failure_url -- where to redirect to on failure

Return JSON: (if no return_url or failure_url provided)
{"status": boolean, "message": "Some message if error"} 

Redirects:
to the return_url (if one is provided)
to the failure_url (if one is provided)
