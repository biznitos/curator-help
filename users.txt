USERS
=====

Curator comes with a built in public user page.

Example:
"https://yoursite.com/user/skylar"

Notes:
Users are assigned a random username upon creation. 
They can change this on the account update page "/account".

Templates:
To display a username, you have to create a template with the permalink "user" (no leading "/").

Template Variables:
In the template, the following liquid data will exists:

* {{member.id}} (the user_id of this user)
* {{member.username}}
* {{member.zid}}
* {{member.role}}
* {{member.data}} (map)
* {{member.notes}}
* {{member.usubscribed}} (boolean)
* {{member.inserted_at}} (date they joined this site)
* {{member.last_here}} (the last time they were here)
* {{member.interactions}} (map)
* {{member.following}} (array of user_id of people who are following)
* {{member.user.all-user-fields}} (read page on user fields)

IMPORTANT
=========
We do not use the {{user}} or {{user_sites}} variables, since these are reserved for the currently logged in user.

You can follow a user if currently logged in:

/api/follow/v1
