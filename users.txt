USERS
=====

Curator comes with a built in public user page.

Example:
"https://yoursite.com/user/skylar"

Notes:
Users are assigned a random username upon creation. 
They can change this on the account update page "/account".

Templates:
To display a username, you have to create a template with the permalink "user".

Template Variables:
In the template, the following liquid data will exists:

* {{member.id}} (the user_id of this user)
* {{member.username}}
* {{member.zid}}
* {{member.role}}
* {{member.data}} (map)
* {{member.notes}}
* {{member.usubscribed}} (boolean)
* {{member.user.all-user-fields}} (read page on user fields)

IMPORTANT
=========
We do not use the {{user}} variable, since this is reserved for the currently logged in user.
