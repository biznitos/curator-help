AI AGENT GENERATOR
==================

Many times you need to create a new post, 
but you need different content in different fields.
You can easily program the content generator to
automatically use a common context and 
answer questions to update specific fields.

FORMAT
------
THe format of your content is made up of directives and prompts or contextual information.
Directives are always on their own line.
Prompts or contextual information can make up any number of lines.

DIRECTIVES:
xxxx:yyyy:zzzz
Context or Prompt

xxxx = "role" -- This must always be there. Can never have another value.
yyyy = "user" -- What this message is for. Values are either "system" or "user".
zzzz = "fieldname" -- The fieldname of the post you need to update. If no fieldname, put "none"

Example:
role:system:none <- This is the first directive and the next lines that follow must be either the context, or the prompt.

Example:
role:user:description <- Update the description field with the prompt below.
