CUSTOMER CAPTURE FORMS
======================

You can capture leads on any site by preparing a form with these attributes

Form Action:
/api/customer/v1

Method:
POST

Default template path:
/go

Required fields:
* subject
* return_url - The URL to go to when the lead form is successful (can contain __zid__ or __id__ in it)
* failure_url - The URL to return to when the lead form failed
* customer[email] - email address of the person filling this form
* customer[name] - name of the person filling the form

Optional fields:
* message
* utm_xxxx - UTM Tracking notification fields. (xxxx can be any or all of: source, campaign, medium, etc)
* location - a mappable address of a place eg: "345 Maple Street, Brookly, NY, 10115, USA"
* customer[phone]
* customer[phone]
* customer[gender] (male/female/other/anything)
* customer[occupation]
* customer[first_name]
* customer[last_name]
* customer[middle_name]
* customer[street]
* customer[city]
* customer[country_code] (eg: US, JM, etc)
* customer[dob] - date of birth
* customer[url]
* customer[meta1]
* customer[meta2]
* customer[meta3]
* data[xxxxx] - xxxxxx can be anything. This allows you to create quite complex forms as needed

NOTE:
Customer[xxxxxx] information will only be added once. 
If the customer already exists in the system, this information 
will not overwrite what's already there. 
Create a profile update form to deal with that.
