LEAD NOTIFICATION TEMPLATE
==========================

Overview
--------
The lead notification template is sent out
automatically from a site when a new lead
is received.

Sent from
---------
It's sent from the user who's information
is in the lead. The recipient can just
hit reply and send an email to this user.

Recipient(s)
------------
There are 3 cases of recipients:

1. If the lead had a "notify" hidden field
containin the ID (zid) of a post, then the
lead will be sent to that recipient.

2. If the lead has a "parent_user_id" which
is the user_site.id of a user, then that
user will receive the notification

3. Fallback will be to the email address
of the site owner as indicated in the
site settings.

4. (TODO) If there is a "bcc" field, then
additionally leads will be bcc'd to the
email addresses in the bcc field (comma separated).

Template
--------
The default template is "leads"
You can override this template by
creating a new email with the type permalink
"emails/leads"

Additionally you can create other templates
that match the type of the lead:
"emails/leads_[type]"
example:
"emails/leads_shopping"

The system will always look for these templates
first before the default template.

Template Variables
------------------
Templates contain most of the same variables
that are in the rest of the system:

{{site}} -- site information
{{post}} -- post information, if a "notify" id was added to the form
{{parent}} -- the user who is references in the "parent_user_id" variable in the lead form
{{lead}} -- the variables in the lead itself as follows:
* id
* zid
* inserted_at
* title
* data - the data variable which containes data[xxxx] from the form
* data.xxxx (example)
* ip - ip address of the user
* ua - user agent of the user
* type - type of the lead
* subtype - subtype of the lead
* post - post of the lead
* user - the user record of the person who created the leads
