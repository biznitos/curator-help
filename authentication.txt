AUTHENTICATING USERS
--------------------

The Curator platform allows you to authenticate users.
No password is used, instead, users enter just an email
address.

They receive an email that contains a special link
which logs in the users.

LOGGING IN
----------
Logging in either creates a new account on the current site,
or uses an existing account.

Create a page with the permalink:
"/auth"

The HTML in the page should like this:

<form method="POST" action="/api/auth/v1">
  <input type="hidden" name="return_url" value="/authin">
  <input type="hidden" name="failure_url" value="/auth">
  <label>Your email address</label>
  <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="me@myemail.com" autofocus="true">
  <button class="button btn expanded success">NEXT &rarr;</button>
</form>

"return_url" and "failure_url" represents urls that they user should redirect to
when the login is successful or a failure.

AUTHORIZING
------------
In the example above, the user is redirected to "/authin" which
is a page that requests the login token. This page should always 
have a permalink of:
"/authin"

The HTML of the page should look like this:

<form method="POST" action="/api/auth_check/v1">
  <input type="hidden" name="return_url" value="/">
  <input type="hidden" name="failure_url" value="/authin">
  <label>
    Check your email for a code we just sent. 
    <b>Then enter it here</b>
  </label>
  <input type="number" name="auth_token" placeholder="999999" autofocus="true">
  <button class="button btn expanded alert">SIGN IN</button>
</form>
  
Again, use "return_url" or "failure_url" to redirect the user to where you'd like them to go.

CHANGING THE AUTHORIZATION EMAIL TEMPLATE
-----------------------------------------

By default, the system has an authorization email which you can override with your own format.

If you want to change this email, create it under the permalink:
"auth"

It should look something like this:
<html>
<head><title>New Lead</title></head>
<body style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;">
  <div style="max-width: 480px;">
    <p>
      Hi,
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's your {{site_name}} sign in code.
      Use it now, because it expires in 15 minutes.
    </p>
    <h3 style="color: green;">{{auth_token}}</h3>
    <p>
