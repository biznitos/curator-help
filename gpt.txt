GPT
===

Use ChatGPT to generate content given inputs from a form.

Step #1 - Create your prompt
----------------------------
Create a post with the type "prompt".
It should have the following information in the following fields:

* post.action:
The actual prompt you are going to use in GPT. 
This prompt can use {{input}} fields taken directly from a form to interpolate in your prompt.

* src
should always be gpt

* src_id
the gpt model ID to use. Defaults to "gpt-3". Example: "gpt-4"
See model names on the GPT documentation website.

Step #2 Create your form
------------------------
Create a form on your webpage that will post to the following endpoint:

POST: /api/autogpt/v1

Example:
<form method="POST" action="/api/autogpt/v1">
</form>
