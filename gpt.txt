GPT ANSWERS
===========

Use ChatGPT to generate content and answers given inputs from a form.

Step #1 - Create your prompt
----------------------------
Create a post with any type you want. We recommend: "prompt".
It should have the following information in the following fields:

* post.action:
The actual prompt you are going to use in GPT. 
This prompt can use {{input}} fields taken directly from a form to interpolate in your prompt.

EXAMPLE PROMPT:
  Your are a travel agent at a company named Baan Smile.
  Baan Smile is a a travel agent that helps people travel to Thailand.
  This question is always about Thailand.
  Give a detailed answer to this question asked by a customer of Baan Smile: "{{title}}".
  Your answer should be between 250 and 500 words.
  At the end explain how Baan Smile can help the person asking to travel to Thailand. 
  Ask the person to email us at hello@baansmile.com if they need futher help.
