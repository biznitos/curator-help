LOGIN
=====

You can use the default login form without doing anything,
or create a form to override it.

FORMAT
------
HTML with Liquid markup

FORM PERMALINK
--------------
/login

ACTION
------
/login (POST)

PARAMETERS
----------
* email - {{params.email}}
* password
* return_url (optional) - {{params.return_url}}
* failure_url (optional)

NOTES
-----
If there was an error, and the failure_url is left blank,
the user will be redirected back to the login form
with the following additonal parameter in the URL:
* error

You can use the error as you see fit as in the example.

REDIRECTING BACK
----------------
When calling the login form, you can have it redirect
back to a place of your own choosing, like so:
/login?return_url=/account

This will instruct the login processor to redirect 
to the "/account" path upon successful login.
