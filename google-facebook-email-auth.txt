AUTHENTICATION
==============

You can use the Revsense authentication system to login/signup with the following providers:

* GOOGLE
* FACEBOOK
* EMAIL

GOOGLE
------
GET URL:
/auth/google

FACEBOOK
--------
GET URL:
/auth/facebook

EMAIL
-----
POST OR GET URL:
/auth/email

PARAMETERS
----------
* return_url (optional - default "/")
Where to go after a successful login. You should URL encode this

* failure_url (optional - default "/")
Where to go after the login has failed. You should URL encode this

* email (required for email authentication)
Only used for optional email type authentication

HOW IT WORKS
------------
After hitting the URL's with the optional parameters, the system will add or login the user, and return to the appropriate return url area.

In all cases, if a new account is being created, the user will need to enter some additional information or confirm the information before going forward.
