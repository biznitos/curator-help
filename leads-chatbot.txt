LEAD GENERATION VIA CHATBOT

You can use a chatbot to ask people for information and guide them through a process.
This will generate a new customer and save the entire chat transcript in their account.

You can have many different chatbots on a single site.

Chatbots will use GPT-5.1 by default.

SYSTEM PROMPT
-------------
The system prompt will contain all the basic information about your business already.
So you need not repeat all that into your custom prompt.
You cannot edit the system prompt.

SETUP YOUR BUSINESS LOGIC PROMPT
---------------------------
Create a text template with any slug eg: "dtv-chatbot".
Type your prompt in this template. 
This will be passed on directly to the LLM.
These site variables can be interpolated:
{{name}}, {{description}}, {{address}}m {{email}}.

CREATE YOUR CHATBOT PAGE
------------------------
Go into the admin and create a new file with the slug "/chatbot".
This will bring in the base code for any chatbot that you can edit.

Open it, edit it, save it, and recommend to rename it to something else.
Exampe "/chatbot/widgets"

** Add the name containing your business logic prompt slug:
data-prompt="xxxxx" which is the slug for your business login prompt.
Example: data-prompt="dtv-chatbot"

** Change the name of your assistant
data-assistant-name="Janice"

Edit and add anything around the chat interface, but leve the key ID's in place, or it will not work.

START CHATTING
--------------
Test the chatbot a few times, and adjust your BUSINESS LOGIC prompt until you get it right.

That's it!
