LEAD CAPTURE FORMS
==================

You can capture leads on any site by preparing a form with these attributes

Form Action:
/api/lead/v1

Method:
POST

Required fields:
* title
* type
* return_url - The URL to go to when the lead form is successful
* failure_url - The URL to return to when the lead form failed
* customer[email] - email address of the person filling this form
* customer[name] - name of the person filling the form

Optional fields:
* subtype
* utm_xxxx - UTM Tracking notification fields. (xxxx can be any or all of: source, campaign, medium, etc)
* customer[phone]
* customer[phone]
* customer[gender] (male/female/other/anything)
* customer[occupation]
* customer[first_name]
* customer[last_name]
* customer[middle_name]
* customer[street]
* customer[city]
* customer[country_code] (eg: US, JM, etc)
* customer[dob] - date of birth
* customer[url]
* customer[meta1]
* customer[meta2]
* customer[meta3]
* data[xxxxx] - xxxxxx can be anything. This allows you to create quite complex forms as needed

NOTE:
Customer[xxxxxx] information will only be added once. If the customer already exists in the system, this information will not overwrite what's already there. Create a profile update form to deal with that.

Lead Notificaiton:
* notify
a Post ID (zid) This makes it easy to make a lead respond to the author of a post. Example, a user can post some ifnormation, then a lead can be captured based on it. An email notification will be sent ot the author of the form with all the above fields captured.

Autoresponder:
* autoresponder
a Post ID (zid). This is good if you want to provide a download or some other information that you want to immediately send to the user. Prepare a post, with an external link to anything you want. Once the lead is submitted, an email will be sent to the submitter with anything you hve in the post.

Leads can be viewed in the Admin.
