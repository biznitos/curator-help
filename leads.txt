LEAD CAPTURE FORMS
==================

You can capture leads on any site by preparing a form with these attributes

Form Action:
/api/lead/v1

Method:
POST

Default template path:
/go

Required fields:
* title
* type
* return_url - The URL to go to when the lead form is successful
* failure_url - The URL to return to when the lead form failed
* customer[email] - email address of the person filling this form
* customer[name] - name of the person filling the form

Optional fields:
* parent_user_id (user_site.id of current user in site)
* subtype
* utm_xxxx - UTM Tracking notification fields. (xxxx can be any or all of: source, campaign, medium, etc)
* customer[phone]
* customer[phone]
* customer[gender] (male/female/other/anything)
* customer[occupation]
* customer[first_name]
* customer[last_name]
* customer[middle_name]
* customer[street]
* customer[city]
* customer[country_code] (eg: US, JM, etc)
* customer[dob] - date of birth
* customer[url]
* customer[meta1]
* customer[meta2]
* customer[meta3]
* data[xxxxx] - xxxxxx can be anything. This allows you to create quite complex forms as needed

NOTE:
Customer[xxxxxx] information will only be added once. 
If the customer already exists in the system, this information 
will not overwrite what's already there. 
Create a profile update form to deal with that.

Lead Notificaiton:
* notify
* parent_user_id
If a Post ID (zid) or parent_user_id is supplied,
The involved user will receive an email notification for the 
user or the author of the post. Example, a user can post some information, 
then a lead can be captured based on it. An email notification will be 
sent ot the author of the form with all the above fields captured.

Notifying multiple people:
To notify a cohort of people, they must first have prepared posts 
that match the type and subtype of the lead.
These posts must also at least contain at least an email address.
To switch on notification, include this variable in your form 
and set to the parent_zid of a post that these posts are children of:
* notify_all
<input type="hidden" name="notify_all" value="{{some_post_zid}}">

Autoresponder (to be deprecated):
* autoresponder
a Post ID (zid). This is good if you want to provide a download or some 
other information that you want to immediately send to the user. 
Prepare a post, with an external link to anything you want. 
Once the lead is submitted, an email will be sent to the 
submitter with anything you hve in the post.

Autoresponder (new)
To create an autoresponder for a lead, setup an email
template with the permalink autoresponder_xxxx,
where xxxx is the type of lead.
example: "autoresponder_cleaning"

In the Autoresponder template, 
the following Liquid variables
are available for use:
{{xxxx}} -- system variables
{{site}} -- site info
{{lead}} -- the lead info
{{lead.user}} -- user who submitted the lead
{{lead.parent_user}} -- parent user of lead
{{lead.parent_user_site}} -- parent user site info
{{lead.post}} -- info from a given post zid

Leads can be viewed in the Admin.
