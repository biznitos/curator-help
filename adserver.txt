AD SERVING
==========

Ads are just posts with:
* title
* cover_photo
* cover_video
* url

Ad Types
--------
* Banner
* Raw HTML
* Text

Creating an ad
--------------
Ads are just simple posts, but you need the following for each kind of ad:

Banner Ads
* title (for alt and identification only)
* url
* type = "ad"
* subtype = "banner"

Raw HTML
* title (for identification)
* content (the raw ad HTML)
* type "ad"
* subtype "html"

Text
* Title
* Description
* Url
* type "ad"
* subtype "text"

Publishing an ad
----------------
Ads are published like you publish any other kind of web content.

Serving Ads
-----------
You can request an ad and put it in an iframe with the following path:

/adserve/:type

Parameters:
* type - banner | html | text.
* r - rotation type: r=random, f=first in, l=last in, c=most popular clicks, v=most popular views
* u - user_id of person who create ads.
* l - limit (default 1)

Ad output is always Raw HTML

Ad Templates
------------
You can override system ad templates with
templates using these permalinks:
* ad_banner
* ad_text
* ad_html

These templates will not render layouts, only the bare content of the template itself.

TODO
====
Additional "template" parameter, example "336x280" 
would use that template to format an ad. 
Not sure best way to implement this as yet.
Could be some element of ad itself.
