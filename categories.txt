CATEGORIES
==========

You can add a special type of content called categories to the system:

1. Create a new post

2. Set the type, subtype and titles as follows:
* type = "category" (must always be "category")
* subtype = [permalink of category]
* title = [title of subcategory]

That's it!
(You thought it would be longer?)
