DRIP CAMPAIGNS
==============

You can setup automated emails that can go out to users.
Or users can set them up themselves based on their individual criteria.

Examples
--------
1. Global Drip Campaign
Setup a campaign to go out to every subscribed user in the system.
It will send out an email based on your schedule you set
with the posts you want as new ones are added or using the
once already there, starting at the beginning.

2. User defined drip campaign
You can setup a page on the site for users to design the kind of
campaign they want.
Exmaple, they can pick a make and model of a car and get 
info based on that.

Setup Global Drip Campaign
==========================
Use the "Drips" menu in the admin to set up one of these.

User Defined Drip Campaign
==========================
A user can subscribe to a drip campaign by using a form like this:

<form method="POST" action="https://admin.revsense.com">
  <h1>Get updates on Portland</h1>
  
  <input type="hidden" name="return_url" value="/thanks">
  <input type="hidden" name="failure_url" value="/subscribe">
  
  <!-- user info (add any other user info fields you need) -->
  <label>Your email</label>
  <input type="email" name="email">
  <label>Your name</label>
  <input type="text" name="name">
  
  <!-- which posts you want to send -->
  <input type="hidden" name="type" value="blog">
  <input type="hidden" name="subtype" value="portland">
  
  <!-- how often you want to send (daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly) -->
  <input type="hidden" name="schedule" value="weekly">
  
  <!-- which day of the week you want to send (sun-sat) -->
  <input type="hidden" name="schedule_weekday" value="mon">
  
  <!-- what time you want to send (24 hour time format) --->
  <input type="hidden" name="schedule_time" value="8:30">

</form>
