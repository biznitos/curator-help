DRIP CAMPAIGNS
==============

Drip campaigns are those that respond to incoming leads.

Every lead has a type.
You can create posts that automatically get sent out based on the type of leads that are coming in.

The title of each post is the subject of the email.
The content of the post is the message of the email.
The subtitle of the post is the preheader of the email.

Creating Posts
--------------
Posts that you designate for drip emails must be formatted as:
type: "drip"
subtype: "foo" (example)

These posts without a subtype will just be sent to everyone in your system.

Creating Leads
--------------
Leads that you want to have a drip campaign for must have a type matching the post subtypes:
type: "foo".

Ordering
--------
Drop emails will be sent in the order they are created.
