TRANSLATION & LOCALE SWITCHING
------------------------------

The system supports switching between two locales.
The default locale is always English (for now).

MARKUP
------
Markup the content that you want to translate as follows with a "tr" class:

Examples:
<div class="tr">Hello world</div>
<option value="123" class="tr">One two three</option>
<title class="tr">Some meta title</title>

TRANSLATING
-----------
You translate the text on the backend manually.

URLS
----

Normally a url could look like this:
https://yoursite.com/blog

To view the Thai version of this url
https://yoursive.com/th/blog

The locale is:
https://yoursive.com/[locale]/blog

It should match the secondary locale your site is set in.

Notes:
The system will automatically change all the URLS for you when you switch

SWITCHING
---------
You can switch languages by just changing the URL

Important:
Add a "notr" attribute so that the system does not change these urls.

Example:

{% if locale == "th" %}
  <a href="/blog" notr="true">English</a>
{% else %}
  <a href="/th/blog" notr="true">Thai</a>
{% endif %}
