PARTIALS
========

Partials are small parts of templates that you can reuse in your code.

Naming 
------
Partials should have a permalink without any leading slashes.
Partials should also have a leading underscore:
Examples:
* _foo
* _customer_list

Gotchas
-------
It's not a great idea to let one partial call another partial.
Also, don't have too many partials on a single page
You'll take a huge performance hit.

Example Use
-----------

<div>
{% partial _customer_list %}
</div>

Context
-------
Partials will use all liquid variables available in the current
context to help render their contents.
