REMIX CONTENT FROM URLS
-----------------------

PURPOSE
-------
Takes a list of posts with URL's and rewrite them based on the urls they point to. 
A good way to rewrite existing content quickly from certain external sources.

HOW
---
Add (or upload from CSV) a list of posts with at least:

* title
* url
* type (format: remix:[type], example: remix:blog)
* permalink

The system will process these posts starting with the oldest one, 
fetch the content of the url, and remix the post with new content.
It will keep the title.

OTHER PARAMETERS
----------------
You can add any other normal post columns, but these are special values:

* subtitle: style=[howto, instructions, information, etc]|words=500|grade=6|model=gpt-4-turbo-preview|extra=additional prompt snippet

Use "|" as the separator between key value pairs.

* style = style of post
* words = max number of words (default 500)
* grade = 6 (default 6)

Once you create the post it will immediately queue it for crawling and creating.
