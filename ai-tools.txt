Summary
Use Ai to create a post from a form. You need these things to make it happen:

1. An HTML form that contains the instructions
2. An LLM prompt
3. A form to contain the results

HTML FORM
---------
Your html form can contain the following hidden fields:
* type - type of post to create
* subtype (optional)
* title (optional - if given will be overriden by any title generated with the LLM)
* other fields - (optional - if given will be overridef by field of the same name generated by the LLM)
* notify - "1" notify the author of this post. They will be sent a link to the post created (you must create a template to view this type of post)
* slack - "1" will send us a slack notification if notification is setup for this site.
* prompt - the permalink of a template containing the prompt used to generate this post. (you must create a template with the prompt itself)
* model - the model of the LLM to use, defaults to "llama3-70b-8192", can also use "gpt-4o" and "gpt-4o-mini" along with other groq models.

LLM PROMPT
----------
The LLM prompt itself must be carefully written to output JSON fields that correspond to normal post field names.
