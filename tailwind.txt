TAILWIND CSS
============

Tailwind is a modern CSS Framework that we encourage everyone to use on our platform:
https://tailwindcss.com

We can incorporate a production build of Tailwind by looking at all of your templates and generating a minified stripped down tailwind.

DEVELOPMENT MODE
----------------
To use the very latest version of tailwind in development mode, use this url in your CSS Include:

URL:
/css/tailwind.css

This will automatically make available a full non-minified version of tailwind for you to use and do your dev with.

We keep this Version of tailwind up-to-date.

PRODUCTION MODE
---------------
To use tailwind that's stripped down based on the styles in your templates, use this url in your CSS Include:

URL:
/css/tailwind.min.css

This will automatically make available a production version of tailwind for you to use.
This version only contains the styles used in your templates.
We automatically watch your templates for changes every 5 minutes and rebuild if needed.
You can also explicitly force a build from the admin.

NOTES
=====
The watcherr will be triggered if you have a CSS file: /tailwind.min.css in your templates.
