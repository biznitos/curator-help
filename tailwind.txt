TAILWIND CSS
============

Tailwind is a modern CSS Framework that we encourage everyone to use on our platform:
https://tailwindcss.com

We can incorporate a production build of Tailwind by looking at all of your templates and generating a minified stripped down tailwind.

SETUP DEVELOPMENT MODE
----------------------
To use the full version of Tailwind in your layout, use from the Tailwind CDN in your layouts:

STYLESHEET:
<link href="https://unpkg.com/tailwindcss@^2/dist/tailwind.min.css" rel="stylesheet">

Then create an empty CSS file in your templates:
/css/tailwind.min.css

This file will later be automatically populated with your Tailwind CSS classes you use in your templates.

Do not add anything in this file, as it will be replaced with the tailwind production build.

PRODUCTION MODE
---------------
When you're ready for production, use this tailwind that's stripped down and ready for production in place of the Development version:

STYLESHEET:
<link href="/css/tailwind.min.css" rel="stylesheet">

This will automatically make available a production version of tailwind for you to use.
This version only contains the styles used in your templates.
We automatically watch your templates for changes every 5 minutes and rebuild if needed.
You can also explicitly force a build from the admin.

NOTES
=====
The watcher will ONLY be triggered for your site if you have a CSS file: /css/tailwind.min.css in your templates.
