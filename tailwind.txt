TAILWIND CSS
============

Tailwind is a modern CSS Framework that we encourage everyone to use on our platform:
https://tailwindcss.com

We can incorporate a production build of Tailwind by looking at all of your templates and generating a minified stripped down tailwind.

DEVELOPMENT MODE
----------------
To use the very latest version of tailwind in development mode, use this url in the CSS Include:

URL:
/tailwind.css

This will automatically make available a full non-minified version of tailwind for you to use and do your dev with.

We keep this Version of tailwind up-to-date.

PRODUCTION MODE
---------------
To use tailwind that's stripped down based on the styles in your templats, use this url in your CSS Include:

URL:
/tailwind.min.css

This will automatically make available a cut down minimized version of tailwind for you to use.
This version is built every few minutes based on changes in your templates.

NOTES
=====
The builder will be triggered so long as you have a CSS include that uses either tailwind.css or tailwind.min.css in your layout files.
