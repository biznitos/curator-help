SHOPPING CART
-------------

The shopping cart experience allows the visit to add many posts to a cart and then check them out into a lead later.
There will be a lead notification sent with the content of the cart.
It operates almost exactly like a lead.

ENABLE CART FUNCTIONALITY
-------------------------
To enable shopping cart functionality on your site, you need to show the 
shopping cart icon container on a minimum of the product page and the checkout page.

Create a container that the system will automatically populate with the cart link and count.

<span id="revsense_cart"></span>

By default, this will be populated with markup that looks like this:

<a href="/cart"><img src="/images/cart.png"><span>5</span></a>

You can change the markup by setting some javascript.
<script>
  var revsense_cart_markup = '<a href="/cart"><img src="/images/cart.png"><span>##CARTNUM##</span></a>';
</script>

By default the checkout page is at "/cart", but you can make this anything you like.

ADD TO CART
-----------
To add something to the cart, create a link like this:

<a href="#" class="cart-add" data-id="{{post.id}}">Add to Cart</a>

To add something to the cart with a specif quantity:

<a href="#" class="cart-add" data-id="{{post.id}}" data-quantity="5">Add to Cart</a>

To indicate something is already in the cart there will be an existing variable:

{{post.in_cart}} (has count of this items in the cart). Null/0 if none.

So to show items already in cart:

<a href="#" class="cart-add" data-id="{{post.id}}">Add to Cart ({{post.items_in_cart}})</a>

REMOVE FROM CART
----------------
To remove something from the cart, you need markup like this:

<a href="#" class="cart-delete" data-id="{{post.id}}">Remove</a>

DECREMENT QUANTITY
------------------
To decrement the quantity of an item in the cart, you need markup like this:

<a href="#" class="cart-dec" data-id="{{post.id}}">-</a>

DECREMENT QUANTITY
------------------
To increase the quantity of an item in the cart, you need markup like this:

<a href="#" class="cart-inc" data-id="{{post.id}}">+</a>

LIQUID CART VARIABLES
---------------------
Once any items are in the cart, there will exist a list of those posts in the {{cart}} variable which you can loop through.
It will also contain a quantity of items in the cart.

{% for post in cart %}
<div>
  <!-- link to the original post -->
  <a href="{{post.permalink}}">{{post.title</a>
  
  <!-- show the quantity -->
  {{post.quantity}}
  
  <!-- show the price formatted as currency ("money" filter in the currency of the post)-->
  {{post.price | money: post.currency}}
  
  <!-- show the extended total formatted as currency -->
  {{post.price | times: post.quantity | money}}
</div>
{% endif %}

CHECKOUT PAGE
-------------
The checkout page is just a template automatically populated with the cart contents.

Permalink:
/cart

You can create a new template with the same name and you will see the markup that you can edit.
However, you can create any permalink.


LEAD NOTIFICATION
-----------------
When a cart is submitted, the lead notification will have all the details.
An invoice will also be created that will have the order.

CRM
---
You can view the full order in the CRM with the invoice
