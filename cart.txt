SHOPPING CART
-------------

The shopping cart experience allows the visit to add many posts to a cart and then check them out into a lead later.
There will be a lead notification sent with the content of the cart.
It operates almost exactly like a lead.

ADD TO CART
-----------
To add something to the cart, create a link like this:

<a href="#" class="cart-add" data-id="{{post.id}}">Add to Cart</a>

To indicate something is already in the cart there will be an existing variable:

{{post.in_cart}}

So to show items already in cart:

<a href="#" class="cart-add" data-id="{{post.id}}">Add to Cart ({{post.items_in_cart}})</a>

SHOW CART INDICATOR
-------------------
To show a cart icon and the number of items in the cart, 
create a container that the system will automatically populate with the cart link and count.

<span id="revsense_cart"></span>

By default, this will be populated with markup that looks like this:

<a href="/cart"><img src="/images/cart.png"><span>5</span></a>

You can change the markup by setting some javascript.
<script>
  var revsense_cart_markup = '<a href="/cart"><img src="/images/cart.png"><span>##CARTNUM##</span></a>';
</script>

CHECKOUT PAGE
-------------
The checkout page is just a template automatically populated with the cart contents.

Permalink:
/cart

You can create a new template with the same name and you will see the markup that you can edit.

LEAD NOTIFICATION
-----------------
When a cart is submitted, the lead notification will have all the details.
