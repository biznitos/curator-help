Place Searches
==============

A place is just a post with:
----------------------------
type: "place"
subtype: any text to filter posts with
lat and lng (required)

Posts that you want to display under posts, 
need to have a type matching place.subtype

Example
-------
Place:
type: "place"
subtype: "poi"

Post:
type: "poi"
subtype: "bar"

Ordering
--------
By default the system will show closest posts to the place.
If doing a full-text search, it will search within a default radius of 10km
All other orderings are respected within the radius.

Template
--------
Create a template with a permalink of "place"
You can then control default ordering, limits, etc.
A list of {{posts}} will be available to you
as well as the {{post}} containing the place info.
