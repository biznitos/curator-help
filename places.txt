Place Searches
==============

A place is just a post with:
----------------------------
type: "place"
subtype: any text to filter posts with
lat and lng (required)

Posts that you want to display under posts, 
need to have a type matching place.subtype

Example
-------
Place:
type: "place"
subtype: "poi"

Post:
type: "poi"
subtype: "bar"

Ordering
--------
By default the system will show closest posts to the place.
If doing a full-text search, it will search within a default radius of 10km
All other orderings are respected within the radius.

Template
--------
Create a template with a permalink of "place"
You can then control default ordering, limits, etc.
A list of {{posts}} will be available to you
as well as the {{post}} containing the place info.

You will also get {{related_posts}} which are
other places close by that you can use in the interface.

Importing City Data
-------------------
To automatically get a list of top city places, 
add the setting to your site:
* cities1000
* cities5000
* cities15000

You'll automatically get a list of 
1000, 5000 or 15,000 cities, with permalinks
like so:
* /united-states
* /united-states/florida
* /united-states/florida/miami
