RAW CONTENT
===========

Sometimes you might need the raw values of some content, 
for AJAX and other requests.

You can get raw content only for:
* a single post
* a single template (with no data attached to it)

Example
-------
/blog/my-trip-to-america?raw=[html|json]
/template-permalink?raw=html

Posts
-----
For posts, using the "html" format will outout  just the content of the post.
If using the "json" format, all post fields will be output, except private fields.

Templates
---------
For templates, only the content area of the template will be output in HTML format.
The content area is parsed any any available liquid variables are interpolated

Parameters
----------
* raw - [html|json]
* u - the user's numeric site ID (user_site.id -- not core user's id)

User Info
---------
In the content area being output, if the "u" parameter is passed,
the following Liquid tags are available
{{raw_user}}
{{raw_user_site}}

Private information, such as passwords etc are removed.

NOTES
-----
This is only triggered when the "raw" parameter is added.

With the exception of JSON, the content_type
may be overriden if the origin content type was detected
as other than HTML.
